# Lightweaver

Better graph visualization

## Usage

Lightweaver is (going to be) a tool to generate diagrams and flowcharts from DSL (diagrams-as-code).

The biggest difference between Lightweaver and other tools is the ability to more effectively
create custom nodes. It should ideally be straightforward to define and then use a custom node type in
the scripting language.

Another planned features is a native table node layout.

This is mainly focused as a tool for software development.  For use in generating visuals for:

- modeling systems
- reverse engineering
- ER diagrams
- Data flow diagrams
- State flow diagrams
- SQL query visualizers
